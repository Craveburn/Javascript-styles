// For this assignment you'll need to concatenate (add together) your first name and last 
// name into a string.  Assign the result of the string concatenation to a variable:
let first = 'Cameron ';
let last = 'Raburn';
let fullName = first + last;

// Add two numbers together, and assign the result in a variable: calculation
let a = 43;
let b = 42;
let c = b + a;

//Add a number and a string together. Store the result in a variable: unexpected
let a = 'cameron is ';
let b = 24;
let c = a + b;
